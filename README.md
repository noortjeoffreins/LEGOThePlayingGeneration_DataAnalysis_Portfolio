### üìä **Executive Summary**
This analysis delves into LEGO‚Äôs evolving strategy to engage adult audiences, marked by the introduction of the 18+ label in 2020. The data reveals the rapid growth of the 18+ portfolio, while the label represents a shift in how LEGO addresses "the inner child," reflecting a broader strategy to foster lifetime engagement.

Patterns in ownership and design point to a three-phase strategy: Play, Roleplay, Display‚Äîa journey seen within LEGO‚Äôs most iconic theme, Star Wars. While spatial analysis showed global consistency, Germany emerged as a standout market for 18+ sets.

By uncovering these trends, this analysis highlights how LEGO balances nostalgia, complexity, and audience diversity to sustain its appeal across generations.

### üéØ **Key Findings**
* **300% Portfolio Growth** Age labels 18+ were introduced in 2020, accompanied by a tripled expansion in the set portfolio.
* **Ownership Characterized** Sets fall into three interest categories, shaped more by personal taste than set size: Niche, Mainstream, and Blockbusters.
* **Lifetime Engagement Through Momentum** The Star Wars theme demonstrates LEGO‚Äôs strategy of offering the same themes across multiple age groups to provide fitting experiences over time.

* Supporting files such as the data dictionary and detailed methodology notebooks.

### üí° **Data Sources**
This project was conducted as part of the Data Analytics Career Program I'm enrolled in. I independently sourced and prepared the datasets, focusing on cleaning the data to ensure unique sets were characterized by their details, inventory attributes, and retail pricing information. To add depth, I queried and aggregated variables from the second data source, enriching the dataset with metrics like total colors and total minifigs. In the process, I reduced a 60k+ tuple dataset to a streamlined 8k records, ultimately merging them to build a comprehensive dataset.
